## Exercise 1: Stat4Race (2nd ed.)

the shortcut for textwrap in vscode is

Process: suppose that $X \sim \text{Unif}(0,1)$ and suppose we draw $\{Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, \ldots\} from yet another $\text{Unif}(0,1)$ until we reach $T$ such that $Y_T \leq X$. We know the PMF of $T$ is $P(T = t) = \frac{1}{t(t+1)} for $t \in \{1,2,3,\ldots\}$. Simulate the process inspect the relationship between the simulation size and approximation error.

```{r}

library(quantstrat)
install.packages("quantstrat")
set.seed(123)
M <- 10
width <- 3
X <- runif(M)
X

Y <- matrix(runif(M*width), ncol = width)
Y

```
