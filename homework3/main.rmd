## Task 1: Go Study!
## Task 2: Essay

Prompt: "Read and understand Friedman’s paper. Write a short essay (< 1 A4 page) to summarize it. Also explain the essence of the auxiliary tests adopted (i.e. Mann-Whitney or KolmogorovSmirnov) and why we use them and not others."

Paper: Friedman, J. H. (2003). On multivariate goodness–of–fit and two–sample testing. *Statistical Problems in Particle Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology, 1,* 311.

### Essay

Friedman (2003) introduces a new method for goodness–of–fit and two-sample testing. The article mentions that there plenty of existing powerful ways of testing in the univariate case. However, these tests loose power dramatically as the dimension (that is, the number of features) increases, also known as the curse of dimensionality. In order to overcome this problem, the author comes up with a clever idea to end up in a univariate case, even in higher dimensions. Briefly, the idea is to train a binary classification model to distinguish between the two samples. This trained binary classifier will assign a score to each sample, which is the confidence score of the sample belonging to the first sample. These scores are then used to construct a test statistic, which is a function of the scores.

Suppose we have two samples, $\{x_i\}^N_{i=1}$ and $\{z_i\}^M_{i=1}$, and we want to test whether they come from the same distribution. The idea is to construct a test statistic, $T$, that is a function of the samples. Then, we can test the null hypothesis that $T$ is distributed according to a certain distribution, say the standard normal distribution. The test statistic is constructed as follows:

## Task 3: Simulation Study

In order to test Friedman’s idea, we will setup a simulation study that will put it into practice. We will be using a logistic regression model to train a binary classifier. We will use the `glm` function from the `stats` package.

To carry on the with example given in the slides, we will be simulating the number of errors by students coding $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^N$ in R vs Python. We will use a Poisson distribution to simulate the number of errors. To simulate tests with different powers, we will use a different $\lambda_x$ and $\lambda_z$ for each test. We will use the following values for $\lambda_x=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $\lambda_z=\{2,4,6,8,10\}$. Also, sample sizes $\{20,50,100,200\}$ will be used. We will use 1000 replications for each test.

We will use Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and the student's t-test to calculate the test statistics. Our null hypothesis is that the two samples come from the same distribution, and the alternative hypothesis is that they come from different distributions. Therefore we will use the **two-sided alternative** hypothesis for all the tests.

## Task 4: Case Study

## Loading the data from the previous homework
```{r Data processing}
# Load the data
load("hw2_data.RData")

# Standardize the data
asd <- lapply(asd_sel, function(x) as.data.frame(x))
td  <- lapply(td_sel, function(x) as.data.frame(x))

# function to scale variation to 1 assuming 0 mean
scale_0mean <- function(x) {
  n <- nrow(x)                    # number of observations
  x <- as.matrix.data.frame(x)
  sdv <- sqrt(diag(t(x) %*% x)/n) # standard deviation
  x <- t(t(x) / sdv)              # divide by the standard deviation
  return(as.data.frame(x))
}

# scale the datasets
asd <- lapply(asd, scale_0mean)
td  <- lapply(td,  scale_0mean)

# Pool the data
asd <- do.call(rbind, asd)
td  <- do.call(rbind, td)
